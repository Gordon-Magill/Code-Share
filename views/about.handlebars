                                            fascination with technology to seeing Toy Story for the first time in 1995. From that point on, she
                                            jumped at any chance to study CG animation throughout her school days. When not at her desk combing
                    through IT support tickets, Arielle can be found either gaming or watching anime with her husband Daniel, her
                    corgi Kana, and cat Kenshin. She is also beginning her fullstack coding journey with UC Berkeley.</p>
